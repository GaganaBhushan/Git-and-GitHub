It's widely used by developers to manage projects efficiently.

Git: Git is a version control system( Version control system is a tool that helps to track changes in code), Git is one of the popular version control systems in the world.

Git is 
✔ free and open source
✔ fast and scalable,
✔ Keep a history of changes and also revert back till the specific phase we want to revert back.
✔ Work on different versions of a project.
✔ Collaborate with others without overwriting each other's work(if multiple people is working on same file,who worked on what, whoes changes need to be commited after acceptance) 

ex: like a bank account - transaction history like when the amount got credited/debited..etc information will be there, similarly in version control system we will have information about code/project which will track the history of a code/project when any new code is added/modified/deleted kind of information.like in which the line the code is modified ..etc

GitHub:
    GitHub is a website(htts://github.com) that is used by developers to store,manage,sharing, and collaborating their code using Git.

    GitHub is proper website in which developers will upload their complete code to it,they can do changes in website only or if developwers do changes in their system that can be reflected in github also.

    When we apply for job, we will give github like in resumen to give full information about our pojects(uploaded in form of folders/repository), HR can directly go and check my work.

    We can also check others GitHub reporsitories.

    GitHub is a website that:
✅ Stores your code in repositories (repos).
✅ Tracks changes using commits.
✅ Allows multiple people to collaborate using branches and pull requests.

Think of GitHub as Google Drive but for code!

Git runs on your computer, while GitHub is an online platform where Git projects are stored.
